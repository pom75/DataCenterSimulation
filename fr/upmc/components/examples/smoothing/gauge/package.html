<p>Component and port for gauges</p>

<p>
The package <code>fr.upmc.components.examples.smoothing.gauge</code>
provides a gauge component used to display value read from a sensor.
Gauge components can be paried when they measure the same phenomenon
using two different means.  They then exchange their last received
values to be able to xompute their deviation from each other.
