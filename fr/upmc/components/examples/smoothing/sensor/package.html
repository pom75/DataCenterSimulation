<p>Component and port for sensor simulators</p>

<p>
The package <code>fr.upmc.components.examples.smoothing.sensor</code>
provides a sensor simulator component and its port used to offer its
service.  The sensor simulator produces normally distributed random
numbers, currently of given (at creation time) fixed mean and standard
deviation.  Hence, it uses subcomponents, created as sequential here,
to compute these numbers.  A subcomponent <code>NormalRNGenerator</code>
computes teh random numbers provided by the sensor simulator, but this
component in turn uses two <code>UniformRNGenerator</code> components
to do so.
