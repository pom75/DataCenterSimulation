<h1>Computing cluster (ALASCA Project '14)</h1>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>The single JVM case</h3>
<p>
The class <code>CVM</code> can the be run as
any Java application, as it appears in this first screen shot before starting
the execution where the source are placed in the subdirectory <code>jars</code>:

<h3>The multiple JVM case</h3>
<p>
In the multiple JVM case, a distributed assembly is created by a distributed
CVM itself defined as a subclass of <code>AbstractDistributedCVM</code>, called
<code>DistributedCVM</code>.  But before going into the code of this class, the
programmer must decide a deployment and its configuration.  A distributed CVM
will be run on several JVM, and eventually on several hosts.  Connecting
components running on different JVM uses RMI, which requires the publication of
remote objects (here component ports) on a RMI registry, and in the openly
available implementations of Java, a RMI registry cannot be changed by code
running on a different host, so one need to have one RMI registry running per
host.  All of these requirements force every part of the distributed CVM to have
informations about the registry and the registry needs to know about the number
of JVM implied in an execution.  A configuration file in XML is used to provide
this information, and such configuration files obey a Relax NG schema provided
with the component model implementation.  In our client server example, it
looks like follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;deployment&gt;
  &lt;cyclicBarrier   hostname="localhost" port="55253"/&gt;
  &lt;globalRegistry  hostname="localhost" port="55252"/&gt;
  &lt;rmiRegistryPort no="55999"/&gt;
  &lt;jvms2hostnames&gt;
    &lt;jvm2hostname jvmuri="provider" rmiRegistryCreator="true"
                  hostname="localhost"/&gt;
    &lt;jvm2hostname jvmuri="consumer" rmiRegistryCreator="false"
                  hostname="localhost"/&gt;
  &lt;/jvms2hostnames&gt;
&lt;/deployment&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This distributed CVM deploys the two same components, a provider and a
consumer, in two distinct JVM called <code>provider</code> and
<code>consumer</code>.  The two JVM are run on the same host,
<code>localhost</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note also that the code need to have access to the schema of the configuration
file, <code>deployment.rnc</code>, put in a subdirectory <code>config</code>.
It also needs to have access to jars of the code: the basic component model,
the code of the component-based application, as well as the following XML tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>isorelax.jar</code></li>
<li><code>saxon.jar</code></li>
<li><code>xml-apis.jar</code></li>
<li><code>xercesImpl.jar</code></li>
<li><code>jing.jar</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
To execute the application, two JVM must be started to execute the global
registry and the DCVM cyclic barrier, and two others to run the components.
Three shell scripts are provided to ease this, the script
<code>start-gregistry</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
java -cp &apos;jars/*&apos; -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy fr.upmc.components.registry.GlobalRegistry config.xml
</pre>

<p>
the script <code>start-cyclicbarrier</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
java -cp 'jars/*' -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy fr.upmc.components.cvm.utils.DCVMCyclicBarrier config.xml
</pre>

<p>
and the script <code>start-dcvm</code>:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo usage: $0 jvmName
  exit
 fi
java -ea -cp 'jars/*' -Djava.security.manager -Djava.security.policy=dcvm.policy fr.upmc.colins.farm3.DistributedCVM $1 config.xml
</pre>
<p>
that requires adaptation for each application and which receives as command
line parameter the name of the JVM it executes in the DCVM deployment.
</p>

<p>
Notice the use of a security manager to give the application the necessary
rights to access the files and use sockets, etc.  The policy file used in this
application is:
</p>
<pre>
grant {
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory:http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0", "read,write";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./config/deployment.rnc", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "./config.xml", "read";
  permission java.io.FilePermission "user.dir/tmp/*.log", "write";
  permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.dir", "read";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1999", "connect, resolve";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1024-", "connect, resolve";
  permission java.net.SocketPermission "*:1024-", "accept, resolve";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "stopThread";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThread";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
};
</pre>

<p>
The next screen shot shows four shell windows with the four command ready to
be executed:
